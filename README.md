# CookGroupBots
## An open source collection of bots to be used by cook groups

___
### Getting Started:
1. Visit https://discord.com/developers/applications to create a discord bot instance
1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 (or newer) installed and clone this repository
1. Run the `main.py` script. It will prompt you for all the information needed

**Note 1:** If you are using the `twitterSuccessPoster`, you must also visit https://developer.twitter.com/ to create a twitter developer account

**Note 2:** There is still substantial work to be done. I have taken on other responsibilities and slowed development of this. I'm making the repo public for others to contribute.
